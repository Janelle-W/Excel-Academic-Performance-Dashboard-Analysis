# Student Habits vs. Academic Performance


**Course:** Knowledge Discovery Techniques and Applications
**University of South Carolina**  


## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationships between student lifestyle habits—such as study hours, Netflix time, social media use, attendance, and part-time employment—and academic performance.  
Using **Microsoft Excel**, the project integrates data exploration, visualization, and scenario modeling to identify key patterns and predict academic outcomes.  

The dataset contains **1,000 simulated student records**, offering insights into how behavioral and lifestyle factors influence exam performance. Through advanced Excel tools, I performed descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling to reveal how students’ habits shape their results.


## Objectives
- Explore and visualize patterns within academic behavior data.  
- Use **PivotTables**, **charts**, and **conditional formatting** to uncover correlations between habits and exam performance.  
- Apply **Goal Seek** and **Scenario Manager** to model potential outcomes and “what-if” conditions.  
- Demonstrate analytical thinking and structured data storytelling through Excel-based modeling.  


## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
**Software:** Microsoft Excel  

**Analytical Tools Used:**  
- **Data Exploration:** Sorting, filtering, and descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, variance).  
- **Visualization:** Column, scatter, histogram, and combo charts to highlight correlations and distributions.  
- **PivotTables & PivotCharts:** Summarized data across attendance, job status, study hours, and exam scores.  
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlighted high/low performers and visualized score ranges.  
- **Goal Seek:** Estimated study hours required to achieve a target exam score.  
- **Scenario Manager:** Modeled multiple study-hour conditions to predict possible outcomes.  

**Key Skills Highlighted:**  
- Data cleaning and organization  
- Correlation analysis and visualization  
- Statistical interpretation  
- Predictive and scenario modeling  
- Dashboard design and professional formatting
